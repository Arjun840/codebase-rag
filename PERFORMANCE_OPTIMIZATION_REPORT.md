- **Impact**: ~40% reduction in retrieval and processing time

### 2. Response Caching
- **Implementation**: In-memory LRU cache with 5-minute TTL

## Detailed Performance Analysis

### Response Time Distribution
```
Original System:
- First Request: 15-20s (cold start)
- Subsequent: 7-8s  
- Variance: High (std dev > 3s)

Optimized System:
- First Request: 6-7s (improved cold start)
- Subsequent: 0.00s (cached) or 4-7s
- Variance: Lower (more consistent)
```

### Bottleneck Analysis

#### Before Optimization:
1. **Document Retrieval**: Retrieving 10 documents was overkill
2. **No Caching**: Every query hit the full pipeline
3. **Large Chunks**: 1000-token chunks slowed embedding generation
4. **Cold Start**: Model loading took significant time

#### After Optimization:
1. **Retrieval**: Optimized to 3-5 most relevant documents
2. **Caching**: 50% of queries now served from cache
3. **Smaller Chunks**: Faster embedding and better granularity
4. **Warm Models**: Models stay loaded, reducing cold start impact

## Concurrent Performance

### Original System
- 3 concurrent queries: 49.47s total
- Poor scalability under load

### Optimized System  
- Better resource utilization
- Cache benefits compound with multiple users
- Lower memory footprint per query

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

### Short-term (Easy wins)
1. **Increase Cache Size**: Bump from 50 to 100 responses
2. **Smart Caching**: Cache based on semantic similarity, not exact matches
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
4. **Response Compression**: Compress API responses

### Medium-term (Moderate effort)
1. **Embedding Model Swap**: Use smaller, faster model (384d vs 768d)
2. **Async Processing**: Pipeline embedding and generation
3. **Batch Processing**: Group similar queries
4. **CDN Integration**: Cache static responses

### Long-term (Major improvements)
1. **Model Quantization**: Use 4-bit or 8-bit quantized models
2. **GPU Acceleration**: Move to GPU-optimized inference
3. **Distributed Architecture**: Separate embedding and generation services
4. **Vector Database Optimization**: Use specialized vector DB

## Configuration Recommendations

### For Different Use Cases

#### Ultra-Fast Mode (< 2s target)
```python
top_k = 2
chunk_size = 500
max_new_tokens = 100
temperature = 0.05
cache_ttl = 600  # 10 minutes
```

#### Balanced Mode (2-5s target)
```python
top_k = 5
chunk_size = 800
max_new_tokens = 150
temperature = 0.1
cache_ttl = 300  # 5 minutes
```

#### Quality Mode (5-10s acceptable)
```python
top_k = 8
chunk_size = 1000
max_new_tokens = 250
temperature = 0.2
cache_ttl = 180  # 3 minutes
```

## Model Alternatives for Speed

### Embedding Models (Speed vs Quality)
1. **Current**: `flax-sentence-embeddings/st-codesearch-distilroberta-base` (768d)
2. **Faster**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384d) - 50% faster
3. **Fastest**: Local embeddings with sentence-transformers optimization

### Generation Models (Speed vs Quality)
1. **Current**: `ollama/codellama:7b`
2. **Faster**: `ollama/codellama:3b` (smaller variant)
3. **Fastest**: Quantized models (4-bit/8-bit)
